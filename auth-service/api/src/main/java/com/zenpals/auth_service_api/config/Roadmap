Here‚Äôs a comprehensive and organized breakdown of essential Spring Security concepts, grouped by their purpose and relevance. This includes configuration, authentication/authorization flows, handlers, token and session management, and more.

üîß 1. Core Configuration (Security Filter Chain)
These classes and interfaces are involved when defining security configurations.

‚úÖ Key Classes/Interfaces
Component	Description
SecurityFilterChain	Defines how security is applied to incoming HTTP requests. Replaces WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter.
HttpSecurity	Fluent API used to configure SecurityFilterChain ‚Äì roles, CSRF, session, JWT, etc.
AuthenticationManager	Main entry point for authentication; delegates to appropriate AuthenticationProvider.
AuthenticationProvider	Validates Authentication (e.g., DaoAuthenticationProvider, custom providers).
UserDetailsService	Loads user-specific data. Interface for fetching user details from DB or other sources.
UserDetails	The returned user information, includes username, password, and roles.
PasswordEncoder	Strategy for encoding passwords (e.g., BCryptPasswordEncoder).

ü™™ 2. Authentication & Authorization Flow
Classes that handle the core login, role checks, and access.

‚úÖ Key Classes
Component	Description
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken	Default implementation of Authentication used for login.
Authentication	Core object representing the current user‚Äôs credentials and authorities.
SecurityContext	Holds the Authentication object for the current request.
SecurityContextHolder	Thread-local storage to access SecurityContext.
GrantedAuthority	Represents an authority (e.g., a role like ROLE_ADMIN).
AccessDecisionManager	Makes final access control decisions.
AccessDeniedHandler	Handles unauthorized access (403).
AuthenticationEntryPoint	Handles unauthenticated access (401).

üö¶ 3. Login/Logout Handling
Used to hook into authentication success/failure events and logout.

‚úÖ Key Handlers
Component	Description
AuthenticationSuccessHandler	Custom logic post-login success (e.g., return JWT or redirect).
AuthenticationFailureHandler	Custom logic post-login failure (e.g., error message).
LogoutSuccessHandler	Custom logic post-logout (e.g., delete cookie).
LoginUrlAuthenticationEntryPoint	Redirects to login page for unauthenticated users.

üîê 4. Token-Based Authentication (JWT / OAuth2)
These are essential if you're working with stateless APIs and JWTs or OAuth2.

‚úÖ Key Components
Component	Description
JwtAuthenticationFilter	Custom filter to extract and validate JWT from requests.
JwtTokenProvider	Utility class to create, validate, parse JWTs.

Annotation	Description
@PreAuthorize	Checks authorization before method execution.
@PostAuthorize	Checks authorization after method execution.
@Secured	Defines required roles.
@RolesAllowed	Similar to @Secured, supports JSR-250.

üõ°Ô∏è 8. CSRF, CORS, and Other HTTP Concerns
‚úÖ Key Configs
Component	Description
CsrfConfigurer	Configure CSRF protection.
CorsConfigurer	Enable/configure Cross-Origin requests.
HttpFirewall	Defends against URL attacks (e.g., double slashes).
RequestMatcher	Matches requests for applying specific rules.

üîÑ 9. Filters & Filter Chain Management
Filters are fundamental in Spring Security.

‚úÖ Important Filters
Filter	Description
DelegatingFilterProxy	Bridges Spring filters to the servlet filter chain.
SecurityContextPersistenceFilter	Loads & stores SecurityContext.
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter	Handles login requests.
ExceptionTranslationFilter	Handles exceptions from the filters below it.
FilterSecurityInterceptor	Performs the actual authorization checks.

üß† 10. Customizations & Utilities
‚úÖ Useful Tools
Component	Description
SecurityConfigurerAdapter	Base class for custom security configurers.
SecurityExpressionHandler	Used for SpEL in @PreAuthorize etc.
SecurityEvaluationContextExtension	Required for SpEL in Spring Data repositories.
